### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Brian from California, and I do content on Web Development. I really enjoy the process of learning new languages and frameworks which has taken me from WordPress to my favorite React. I also enjoy ui, ux, and design procress in general. I often spend time on dribble or upsplash looking for motivation and inspiration.
