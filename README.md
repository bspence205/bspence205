<img src='/banner.png'>

I discovered my love for programming during the COVID-19 lock down and have committed myself to learning the Javascript tech stack. I have 2 years of experience in building engaging user experiences through efficient website design/development, proactive feature optimization for consumer engagement, and debugging through chrome dev tools. I specialize in using front end technologies for developing responsive web designs and user experiences. As a Front End Developer, I've worked on both website clones using the Javascript stack like ReactJS and NextJS, as well as vanilla Javascript projects to build & scale them to completion. I have proven experience developing modern component based websites using HTML, CSS, Javascript, ReactJS and NextJS.

In my free time, I enjoy bonding with my pet corgi Gatsby, working out and traveling. 

Skills: HTML / CSS / JS / ReactJS / NextJS / NodeJS 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a ReactJS project to clone the front end of Facebook.com that allows login functionality through Next.JS NextAuth. Besides that I am regularly practicing my HTML, CSS and Javascript fundamentals with a focus in responsive website design and dom manipulation.
