I discovered my love for programming during the COVID-19 lock down and have committed myself to learning the Javascript tech stack. I specialize in using front end technologies for developing responsive web designs and user experiences. As a Front End Developer, I've worked on both website clones using the Javascript stack like ReactJS and NextJS, as well as vanilla Javascript projects to build & scale them to completion. Along my journey I realized my passion existed in creating digital experiences for others. With this passion, I have dedicated myself to develop real world usable code by reading documentation, getting coaching sessions through my mentor and by progressing through personal projects.

Skills: HTML / CSS / JS / ReactJS / NextJS / NodeJS 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a ReactJS project to clone the front end of Facebook.com that allows login functionality through Next.JS NextAuth. Besides that I am regularly practicing my HTML, CSS and Javascript fundamentals with a focus in responsive website design and dom manipulation.
