Hi! I'm Brian, a curious and problem solving Front End Developer. 

I was first drawn to Front End Development by the way it combines creativity, logic and design to create products with user needs in mind. Since then, I have been constantly seeking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and apply my skills to design in the exciting digital age. 

As a Front End Developer, I embrace the challenge of turning complex goals into easy to use designs to create better user experiences through the design thinking process. With a 3 year background in accounting, I developed my ability to analyze problems which I apply to my development process in understanding the what, when, how, and why. Furthermore, I excel in strong team atmosphere with the ability to work collaboratively and cross-functionally and value different perspectives and efficiencies. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my pet corgi Gatsby, exercising and traveling. 

My core strengths include being adaptable, problem solving, and being learning oriented.
